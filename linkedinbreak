During my time with Our Recipe for Unity, I took the opportunity to self-teach basic web design and development. Recognizing a passion for immersive digital spaces--as well as a belief that style can BE substance--I made a conscious decision to enhance my skill set and truly learn how to make websites. 

I already had proficiency in basic HTML, which allowed me to grasp the fundamental principles of web design; however, I wanted to unlock the full potential of interactive AND attractive web applications. After much research, I dedicated myself to learning JavaScript and ReactJS, two powerful technologies that would enable me to elevate my work.

I took on an ambitious project in order to further my skills: clickbAIt, my multiplayer browser party game, which served as a hands-on learning experience for JavaScript and ReactJS. Through this project, I honed my skills in creating engaging user interfaces that make you want to come back (and the game has been played a thousand times in a year as a result).

In addition to the game, I undertook the creation of several personal websites. These websites allowed me to explore diverse design concepts, experiment with new technologies, and further refine my nascent coding abilities. I am now equipped to create even more exceptional and innovative digital experiences for clients and users alike.

Now armed with a solid understanding of web design and development, CSS+SCSS, and the MERN stack, I am eager to embark on the next phase of my career. I am ready to collaborate with like-minded professionals and organizations. My journey during this career break has instilled in me a sense of purpose and the drive to create remarkable digital spaces.
